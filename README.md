# CLI Chat application-Python

 Its a CLI application, can be viewed in any machine.
 Before running, check your machine ports and adjust the same with the scripts

 1. First Run the server.py
 2. Then run the client.py as per the number of user's wishes
 3. Note:- server to client CONNECTIONS will close once the active users go above 20
 4. Also check the log.txt incase of any errors encountered, log file is properly documented
 5. The Chat is encrypted with a basic caesar cipher, which can be implemented dynamically if the rotations of the cipher encryption and decryption are randomised and handshake exchanged in each message exchange.
